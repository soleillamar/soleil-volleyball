            <h4>Setter:</h4>
              <p>The setter often receives the second touch and sets it to an attacking player. They are like the leader of "offense". Setters also need to be prepared to receive opposing team's attacks near the net.</p>
            <h4>Spiker:</h4>
              <p>Spikers are the attacking player in volleyball. After receiving a set from another player, they preform attacks directly to the opposing team. Front-row spikers can also block the opposing team's attacks. </p>

            <h4>Receivers:</h4>
              <p>Receivers are all about defense. They are prepared to hit any ball that may come there way. Unlike liberos, back-row receivers can spike a ball over the net. Usually, recievers pass the ball to the setter, setting up an attack.</p>
            <h4>Libero</h4>
              <p>Liberos fall under the receiver class. They can not spike if the ball is anywhere over the net. Liberos do not serve at any time in the game. Liberos are often the most equipped skilled defensive player in the game</p>
